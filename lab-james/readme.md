# Cowsay Client Using Angular
This is a client-facing CRUD app that uses Angular and the Cowsay module through Node. It allows a client to input text and have it repeated in the form of a cow saying their text. The build files are created using `Webpack` and `SCSS` is used for styling.

## Installation
Clone the repo and simply type `npm i` to install dependencies. Then, make sure and `webpack` on your command line to create the build files. Next, in the root directory there should now be `build/index.html` which can be used to test the app.

## Testing
Testing is limited to using `lint` for errors. To test files, run `npm run lint`.

Also, to watch files for changes you can run `npm run watch`.
